## Trade Review

*A factual account of each trade executed during this cycle. No interpretation here — plain facts only.*

| #   | Asset | Direction | Entry price | Entry time | Exit price | Exit time | Exit reason                            | P&L |
| --- | ----- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- | --- |
| 1   |       |           |             |            |            |           | [TP / SL / Time / Manual / Still open] |     |
| 2   |       |           |             |            |            |           |                                        |     |

**Execution notes:** [Were all intended trades placed? Were there any missed triggers, failed orders, slippage, or API errors? State factually.]

## Analysis Accuracy Assessment

*Did the Analysis Agent's predictions reflect what actually happened? Assess each key claim from `analysis.md`.*

| Claim from analysis.md  | Predicted direction/outcome             | Actual outcome           | Accurate?            | Notes |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----- |
| [Market assessment]     | [e.g., Bullish]                         | [e.g., Market rose 3.2%] | [Yes / No / Partial] |       |
| [Per-asset thesis: BTC] |                                         |                          |                      |       |
| [Key risk flagged]      | [e.g., Fed risk expected to be neutral] |                          |                      |       |
| [Tail risk flagged]     |                                         |                          |                      |       |

**Analysis accuracy verdict:** [High / Medium / Low]  
**Key miss:** [If there was a significant analytical error, state it plainly. What did the analysis get wrong, and what was the actual cause?]

---

## Strategy Assessment

*Did the strategy specification translate into rational, correctly-structured execution instructions?*

- **Entry conditions:** [Were they specific enough to trigger correctly? Too tight? Too loose?]
- **Exit conditions:** [Were take-profit targets realistic? Were stop levels appropriate relative to the thesis?]
- **Position sizing:** [Was allocation appropriate for the conviction level and market conditions?]
- **Validity window:** [Was the window length appropriate for the strategy type?]
- **Risk management limits:** [Were the portfolio-level limits well-calibrated for conditions?]

**Strategy specification verdict:** [Sound / Minor issues / Material issues]  
**Primary issue (if any):** [State it plainly.]

## Overall Assessment

[3–5 sentences. What happened this cycle, why, and what is the system's current state as a result? Include: did the strategy work and why/why not; what was the dominant market factor that most affected the outcome; is the current portfolio position a reasonable starting point for the next cycle. No recommendations yet — this section is diagnosis only.]

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

*Direct, actionable guidance for the Plan Agent and downstream agents. State what should change, what should continue, and what requires attention.*

**For the Plan Agent:**
- [What signals or themes should be prioritized in the next research pass?]
- [Were there signals this cycle that the system missed or underweighted?]
- ...

**For the Analysis Agent:**
- [Were there systematic analysis errors to guard against? E.g., consistent optimism bias, inadequate tail risk assessment.]
- ...

**For the Synthesis Agent:**
- [Were there strategy construction issues to avoid? E.g., entries too aggressive, stops too tight, over-allocation to low-conviction positions.]
- ...

**Portfolio stance for next cycle:**  
[Hold / Reduce exposure / Increase exposure / Exit specific positions / No change recommended]  
[1–2 sentences of reasoning.]
