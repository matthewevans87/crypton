# Agent Memory
**Agent:** <!-- e.g., Plan Agent, Research Agent, Analysis Agent, etc. -->  
**Last updated:** <!-- ISO 8601 datetime of last write -->

*This file is the agent's persistent knowledge store across Learning Loop cycles. It is read at the start of each cycle and updated at the end. It is private to this agent — other agents do not read it directly. Entries should be concise and actionable. Archive or delete entries that are no longer relevant.*

---

## Standing Watchlist

*Assets, signals, themes, or sources that this agent monitors every cycle regardless of the current Research Agenda. Updated as the agent develops its own standing priorities.*

- **[Item]:** [Why it is on the standing watchlist. What to look for. When to escalate it to the Research Agenda.]
- ...

## Persistent Signals

*Signals or themes that have appeared across multiple cycles and have not yet resolved. These feed directly into Section 1 (Meta-Signals) of `plan.md`.*

| Signal        | First observed | Cycles observed | Current trend                                   | Notes        |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| [Signal name] | [ISO date]     | [N]             | [Strengthening / Stable / Weakening / Resolved] | [Brief note] |

---

## Cycle Notes

*A rolling log of per-cycle notes: what worked, what didn't, useful observations, and anything else worth remembering. Newest entries at the top. Trim entries older than 30 days unless they remain relevant.*

### [Cycle datetime]

- [Note. Keep brief — 1–2 sentences per point.]

## Source Quality Notes

*Observations about specific sources: reliability, known biases, useful for certain signal types, should be avoided, etc. Shared across cycles so the agent builds a working source map over time.*

| Source              | Type                           | Quality                            | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Source name / URL] | [Primary / Secondary / Social] | [High / Medium / Low / Unreliable] | [Specific notes on bias, freshness issues, or strengths] |

## Self-Corrections

*Things this agent has learned about its own tendencies and errors, based on evaluation feedback and its own observations. These are standing adjustments to the agent's approach.*

- **[Date]:** [What the evaluation or experience revealed. What to do differently.]
- ...

---

## Deprioritized Signals (Rolling)

*Signals observed in recent cycles that did not make the Research Agenda. Kept here for reference in case they resurface or become relevant.*

- **[Signal] ([Cycle date]):** [1 sentence. Why deprioritized. Flag if it has appeared more than twice — may need elevation to Persistent Signals.]
